# Data-Analysis-Dashboard-3
The objective of this project is to analyze hotel booking data to identify trends, customer behaviors, and key factors influencing booking cancellations. The insights will help hotel management improve occupancy rates, optimize pricing strategies, and enhance customer satisfaction.

## Key Questions (KPIs)

1.	What is the overall booking cancellation rate?
2.	What are the peak booking seasons?
3.	Which customer segments have the highest retention rate?
4.	How does lead time affect cancellations?
5.	What is the average revenue per booking?

## Process
1.  Data Cleaning & Preparation – Handling missing values, filtering out irrelevant records, and structuring the dataset for analysis.
2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Identifying trends in booking patterns, customer segments, and cancellations.
3.	KPI Calculation & Visualization – Creating Power BI dashboards to track cancellation rates, revenue trends, and booking seasonality.
4.	Predictive Analysis (if applicable) – Using historical trends to forecast future booking demand and customer behavior.

   
## Project Insights
•	The majority of rides occur during peak office hours, indicating high demand in urban areas.
•	Customers prefer shorter rides, with an average trip distance of 5-10 km.
•	Surge pricing increases revenue but leads to a temporary decline in ride requests.
•	Driver ratings are highly influenced by ride quality and punctuality.

## Final Conclusion
By leveraging data-driven insights, hotels can implement better customer retention strategies, 
optimize pricing models, and reduce cancellation rates.Additionally,
offering incentives for direct bookings and targeting repeat customers can significantly improve overall revenue and occupancy rates.
